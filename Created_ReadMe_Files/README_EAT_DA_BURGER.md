## Description
This application is designed for a burger restaurant where customers can make a list of burgers to try, and then rate them. It utilises handlebars and SQL database

## Files
This applictaion is made up of: The main file controlling the application is server.js, and it utilises a connection.js and orm.js to connect to the mySQL database. It also contains starter code for SQL a controller script. The public folder has a css file, a front end javascript and a a burger image file using transparant background.

## Installation
For local server: To start off, copy schema.sql and seed.sql into mySQL Workbench, or use them in the command line in node. Then use install on npm, express, express-handlebars, and mysql. Alternatively, access the application on Heroku.

## Usage
You will start off with a 'bucket list' of burgers. Once you have tried that burger, hit the "Eat Me" button. It will then move to your 'favourites' list where you can rate the burger using emojis. You favourites list sorts based on your rating, so you keep your favourites near the top. Any new burgers go to the top by default to encourage you to rate them. You can also add burgers to the bucket list in the 'New Burger' section.

## Design
I used colour scheme of yellow, orange and red as they are considered "hungry" colours in markerting design. They are used by a lot of bread-based reastaurancts because it increases appetite, such as Macdonalds and Bread top. The image at the back it to appeal to a casual audience who love burgers.
