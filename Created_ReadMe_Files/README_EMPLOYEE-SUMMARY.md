## Description
This application generates a team profile page for a typical development team.

## Files
This applictaion is made up of: In the main directory is app.js and two JSON files, and within folders it contains a series of javascript and html pages, as well as node modules. 

## Installation
Thisapp is accessable via node. Open directory in termainal and enter 'node app' to start.

## Usage
As above.

## Design
The initial design is themed on 'The A-Team' TV series. This was acheived by using a camo background in the jumbotron, and personaising each employee card with a charachter from the A-Team. Using pop culture references in team building can help build team comoraderie. This initail theme could eventually be built to include other teams (X-Men, Smurfs, LOTR etc) which could be manually selected or randomly assigned.
